Richard Feynman, a renowned physicist, emphasized the danger of self-deception in a speech he gave in 1974. He stated that the first principle of self-doubt is self-deception, cautioning that we should not fool ourselves because we are often the easiest person to deceive. Feynman observed that people have a tendency to deceive themselves, particularly if it helps them avoid pain. For example, some individuals may hold onto the belief that their lost loved ones are still alive, despite flimsy evidence, simply because accepting the truth would be too uncomfortable. Similarly, people deceive themselves about their own importance, falling victim to the spotlight effect and overestimating how much others notice and value them. Feynman advised against lying to oneself and acknowledged that self-deception is a natural response to pain and discomfort, but he urged people to be aware of their tendency to deceive themselves.

In addition to Feynman's warning about self-deception, another cognitive bias that contributes to our flawed thinking is the avoidance of inconsistency. An example is provided of a person named Bob, who enthusiastically invested a significant amount of money in what he believed to be a guaranteed stock investment. However, when the stock's value plummeted by 50% within six months, Bob refused to acknowledge his mistake and instead insisted on buying even more shares. This inconsistency avoidance tendency highlights our inclination to stick to our initial decisions, even when they prove to be unwise or detrimental.
