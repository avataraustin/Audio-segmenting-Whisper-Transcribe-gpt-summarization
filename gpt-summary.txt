The importance of focusing on individuals and their specific goals when creating an estate plan is emphasized by attorney Christie Barton. He advises clients not to be influenced by societal expectations but to consider their own desires. Barton also discusses various tools and strategies, such as trusts, that can be used to protect assets and minimize taxes. He specifically highlights the benefits of using Missouri law to create an asset protection trust that can help individuals qualify for Medicaid benefits while safeguarding their assets from estate recovery. However, he also discusses the potential risks and limitations of using trusts in Iowa, especially in relation to long-term care expenses and prison-related claims. Barton concludes by mentioning that his firm charges a flat fee for their services, providing clients with upfront clarity on costs.

In addition to this, the speaker discusses their approach to business and how they now provide fixed fee quotes instead of charging by the hour. They share a story about a client who was overcharged by their lawyer and emphasize the importance of providing estimates. The speaker primarily works with trusts as the foundational platform for estate planning and emphasizes the benefits of joint trusts. They explain the concept of a tax basis bridge, which allows for a 100% basis step-up on assets owned by a joint trust in community property states. They provide examples of how this can be beneficial and stress the significance of considering basis step-ups in estate planning. The speaker also suggests the possibility of using a general power of appointment to include assets in a person's federal estate and obtain a basis step-up, highlighting the value of such step-ups in terms of tax benefits.
